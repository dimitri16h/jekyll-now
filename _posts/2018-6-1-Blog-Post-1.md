16.7%. 2 of 12 total weeks. That's how far we are into our Web Development Classes here at Awesome Inc for the 2018 Summer Cohort. We are trying to learn dozens of new skills here in just 3 months, to say that the information is coming fast is an understatement. It can be tough, but anything worth doing is difficult.

Alot of people will tell you that the reason they chose to take part in a web development program or bootcamp like this, is to learn to make websites. It's true, that's what we are here to do, but they are missing a key part. Learning to make websites is the method in which we are taught, but it's not what we are being taught. We are learning concepts along the way that can later be reapplied in multiple different ideas, projects or professions.

On a technical level, it's much easier to see, you can look at the technologies and languages we learn to use. In our first couple weeks we worked with a pretty large stack of languages and technologies already that include:

	Git
	GitHub

	HTML
	CSS
	Javascript

	Node.js & npm
	Gulp
	Sass
	Bootstrap
	Express.js

	Heroku

While we can use all of these technologies to build the basis for a website, and we will add tools to them to make our websites more interactive and exciting, these aren't all that we are learning. Each of these tools has a specific process in a development cycle. By learning what goes into a development cycle and why we use each tool or what it does behind the scenes, we gain a better understanding of the bigger picture. For example, we learned git and github, not just to make websites, but to teach us about why version control is helpful and we learned about their features and how they work so that later, we understand what version control has to offer. Even if git doesn't meet our needs for a project, or we are required to use different version control, we know what we need and how to use it.

Another example that can be seen is in the languages that we learn. Take JavaScript for example, we are taught JavaScript and it is capable of helping us in web development, but in learning Javascript, we learn about data types, object-oriented programming, prototyping, loops etc. All of this applies to many other programming languages as well. By learning the basic concepts and the reasons that we use them, it becomes alot easier to pick up any handful of other languages. Learning new languages is as simple as remembering the difference in syntax. You can make an entire set of logic for a program on paper, without ever touching a computer and then write that logic into any language you please, if you know the concepts and syntax.

So far, I'm extremely optimistic going forward. All the things that we learn can, and have been confusing or intimidating at first, but I believe the most important thing to know about a program like this is that you have to give it your all in order to get the most out of it. This means putting in the hours, working on side projects that you make up on your own to learn additional technologies or add to a portfolio, and diving deeper into anything that didn't quite click in class. If you come with the desire to learn and do something great, it shows, and your possibilities are endless.
